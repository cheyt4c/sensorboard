# Sensorboard PCB v2

## Changes from v1

 * Schematic will reflect intended PCB design, not current breadboard setup
 * More connectors need to be added on for expansion. I2C address conflict issue (for at least additional IMUs) will need to be addressed.
 * Sensor board will be generic enough to be reused multiple times if needed
 * LED panel connector fix? (missing GND wire)
